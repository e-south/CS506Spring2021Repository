review sections of the nda on rolling basis rather than requiring the entire application to be submitted to begin the review products with fast track designation also may be eligible for more frequent

the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively the affordable care act has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and has

against healthcare fraud and abuse add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and impose additional health policy reforms font div div style line style font style line style font provisions of the affordable care act have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to repeal or replace them or to alter their interpretation and implementation for example the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december eliminated the tax based shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section a of the internal revenue code of commonly referred to as the individual mandate effective january in december the united states district court for the northern district of texas ruled that the individual mandate is unconstitutional as result of the associated tax penalty being repealed by congress as part of the tax cuts and jobs act and ii the individual mandate is not severable from the rest of the affordable care act and as result the entire affordable care act is invalid in december the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed the district court decision that the individual mandate is unconstitutional but remanded the case to the district court to reconsider the severability question it is unclear how the ultimate decision in this case which is now pending before the united states supreme court or other efforts to repeal replace or invalidate the affordable care act or its implementing regulations or portions thereof will impact our business additional legislative changes regulatory changes and judicial challenges related to the affordable care act remain possible any such changes could decrease the number of individuals with health coverage it is possible that the affordable care act as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future and other healthcare

our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates if approved font div div style line style font style line style font addition other legislative changes have been proposed since the affordable care act was enacted for example recent legislative enactments have resulted in medicare payments to providers being subject to reduction of on average two percent referred to as sequestration until continuation of sequestration or enactment of other reductions in medicare reimbursement for drugs could affect our ability to achieve profit on any candidate products that are approved for marketing font div div style line style font style line style font expect that the affordable care act as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been adopted and may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that
